# Les Meilleurs

Dance practice, made readable. Record your choreography on your phone, and Les
Meilleurs maps each dancer's position onto a top-down stage view so you can see
exactly where formations drift — and how to fix them.

## What you can do

### See your formations from above
Record a video of your group dancing (or pick one from your library), mark the
stage corners on screen, and the app produces an interactive top-down formation
view. You'll see every dancer's position across time — gaps, crowding, and
drift all become visible at a glance.

### Compare your take against a reference
Got a trend you're trying to nail? Pick a reference clip, then record your
attempt. The app aligns both performances in time and scores how closely you
match. See which sections you've got and which need more reps.

### Get AI coaching

After analyzing, hit "Run coaching agents" to receive a full report produced by
a team of specialist agents. Each agent owns a narrow domain and delivers
data-grounded feedback with strengths, issues, suggestions, evidence, and a
confidence score.

Three specialists are available:

| Agent | Solo | Group | Domain |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| **Observation** | ✓ | ✓ | Camera visibility, pose readability, occlusion, tracking reliability. |
| **Timing** | ✓ | ✓ | Reference timing offset (Mode B), movement-pulse consistency, beat alignment to audio, group synchronization. |
| **Formation** | — | ✓ | Relative dancer spacing, crowding rate, spatial drift, reference formation match. |

#### How the coaching team works

The **orchestrator** (`run_coaching`) coordinates the agents as a gated pipeline:

1. **Context extraction** — structured metrics are pulled from the analysis
   result: detection coverage, pose rates, occlusion events, movement peaks,
   pair distances, DTW offsets, beat alignment, and more.
2. **Observation gates the team** — the Observation Agent runs first. If it
   can't verify video quality (confidence < 0.55, or a high-severity visibility
   / tracking / group-visibility issue exists), Timing and Formation are
   paused with a clear reason. This prevents unreliable data from producing
   misleading feedback.
3. **Remaining agents run in parallel** — if Observation passes, Timing (and
   Formation for groups) execute concurrently.

#### Deterministic-first, agent-enhanced

Coaching works **without any API key**. Leave `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
`LLM_API_KEY` empty to use the deterministic path, which relies on pure
functions that inspect the analysis metrics directly — no model calls, no
hallucinations, always reproducible.

Optionally set `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or the legacy `LLM_API_KEY`) in
`backend/.env` to enhance reports. When configured, the OpenAI integration
runs typed specialist agents through the Agents SDK:

1. Each specialist uses focused tools to inspect the same structured metrics
   and derived evidence available to the deterministic path.
2. Each agent returns a typed result with a summary, strengths, issues,
   suggestions, and confidence.
3. If an LLM call fails, times out, or returns invalid JSON, the agent
   **falls back to its deterministic counterpart** transparently. Users never
   see a broken report.
4. A synthesis agent combines the specialist results into the overall summary,
   while the orchestrator preserves per-agent scores, evidence, coordination
   notes, provenance, and fallback status in the `CoachingReport`.

This architecture means the coaching team degrades gracefully: LLMs improve
language quality and depth, but the system is fully functional without them.

## Screens

- **Practice** — your home tab. See session history, start a new session.
- **Analyze** — interactive formation view with scrub-able timeline, dancer
  overlays, and coaching reports.
- **Groups** — coming soon: share takes with your crew (analysis stays private
  until you choose to share).
- **Profile** — privacy guidance and camera/photo-library permission details.

## Two analysis modes

**Mode A — Formation:** One video in, formation map out. Perfect for quick
check-ins after rehearsal.

**Mode B — Comparison:** Reference video + your attempt. The analyzer aligns
both performances with DTW, then scores per-dancer deviation. Great for trend
practice and before/after comparisons.

## Quick start (mobile)

```sh
npm install
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go on your device.

## Connecting to the backend

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

For iOS simulator, use `localhost`. For a physical iPhone on the same WiFi, use
your Mac's local IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.5:8000`).

When `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is unset, the app runs with local mock analysis.

## Quick start (backend)

Requirements: Python 3.12, Docker, and Docker Compose. Apple Silicon is a
supported development environment; see the ARM64 compatibility notes below.

```sh
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

The API is at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive docs at `/docs`.

Services: API (`:8000`), Celery worker, Postgres (`:5432`), Redis (`:6379`),
MinIO/S3 (`:9000`, console `:9001`).

### Backend tests

From `backend/`, install the test dependencies and run pytest:

```sh
pip install -e '.[test]'
pytest
```

The Expo package currently provides start commands for mobile and web, but no
separate JavaScript test script.

### Model assets

Place these in `backend/models/` (mounted into the Docker container):

| File | SHA-256 |
|------|---------|
| `yolo11n.pt` | `0ebbc80d4a7680d14987a577cd21342b65ecfd94632bd9a8da63ae6417644ee1` |
| `pose_landmarker_lite.task` | `59929e1d1ee95287735ddd833b19cf4ac46d29bc7afddbbf6753c459690d574a` |

### Coaching via API

```sh
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sessions/$SESSION/coach" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"is_group":true,"expected_dancer_count":4}' | jq .
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sessions/$SESSION/coach" | jq .report.agents
```

Set sponsor credentials only in the ignored `backend/.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-nano
AGNES_API_KEY=
AGNES_BASE_URL=https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1
AGNES_MODEL=agnes-2.5-flash
ZO_API_KEY=
ZO_API_URL=https://api.zo.computer
GMI_API_KEY=
GMI_BASE_URL=https://api.gmi-serving.com/v1
GMI_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.4-nano
```

OpenAI uses typed specialist agents after a deterministic observation gate.
Agnes reviews one selected derived JPEG evidence moment at a time, never a raw
video. Retryable capacity failures get one bounded compatibility-model attempt.
Zo export is an explicit private/unlisted action; reminder creation is separate
and opt-in. Each report is written to
`/home/workspace/les-meilleurs/practice-reports/<session>-<export>.json` in the
user's Zo workspace, then read back and SHA-256 verified before the app says it
was saved. Open Zo's Files view and navigate from `home` → `workspace` →
`les-meilleurs` → `practice-reports`; the app also displays the exact selectable
path after a successful export. Missing or failed providers leave deterministic
coaching usable and appear as `not_configured`, `fallback`, or `failed` in
report provenance.

GMI Cloud serverless inference independently audits draft coaching against only
aggregate measurements and deterministic evidence text. Its model, latency,
request ID, token counts, and fallback status appear in provenance. The separate
`backend/Dockerfile.gmi` remains an optional GPU Compute deployment lane; CUDA
success is recorded only after a real runtime probe. See
`backend/deploy/gmi/README.md` for that optional path.
